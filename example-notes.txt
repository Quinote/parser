cortical: consciousness
subcortical: below your level of awareness
fovea: thumbnail-sized spot of best vision
two types of photoreceptors:
	cones: color, less precise (larger receptive fields)
	rods: more sensitive, colorblind
3 layer filter in the retina: photoreceptors -> bipolar cells -> ganglion cells -> optic nerve
blind spot: where optic nerve leaves (you can't put photoreceptors there)
lateral geniculate body/nucleus: part of thalamus that processes signals from retina; has 6 different layers; segregates retinal signals to 2 different pathways
	magnocellular: layers 1-2
	parvocellular: layers 3-6
default mode network: 'mind-wandering'; 'internal mentation'; 'nonsensical narratives of our day'; introspective; activity mostly in the middle of the brain; stimulus-independent thought
amygdala: salience detector; alarm; pay attention
insula: 'island'; sentient self/material me; perceiving internal body (intraception); important for emotion integration
